# Human Resource Machine

[Human Resource Machine][1] is a fun, little, dark-humoured puzzle game that either
can teach you assembly from the ground up or allow you to put your existing
assembly knowledge into practice in coming up with speed/size optimized
solutions to increasingly hard problems.

This repo contains my working solutions. Even though the programs are created
through a drag-and-drop interface within the game, copy/paste from/to the
clipboard works as assembly source code seen in this repo.
